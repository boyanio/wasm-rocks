[Rockstar](https://codewithrockstar.com) is a computer programming language designed for creating programs that are also hair metal power ballads.

This is a work-in-progress transpilation for the Rockstar language to WebAssembly. You can choose to transpile to WebAssembly's [text format](https://webassembly.org/docs/text-format/) or [binary encoding](https://webassembly.org/docs/binary-encoding/).
